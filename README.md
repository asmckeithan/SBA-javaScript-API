Objective : Creating a website that implemented a random DOG API, with background music and input form to post additional JSON data 
 > creating the API was a hurddle, with trying to implement the apikey and obtaining the url once I logged the data
> Next was creating a form to input data into a JSON object. Not so challenging, but posting the data created an ERROR 405 unfortunately
> Will revist this for future modifications. I realized the jsonplaceholder url could be modified to obtain the correct information by creating my own.
> Finally importing the data was also a challenge and could be the reason for my 405 error to begin with.
> I learned that with the random API, there were several hiccups.
> 1. Running audio with random photos and gifs created an error at times. IT appears chrome will cancel out the audio if a certain gif is running at the same time.
> 2. I will be researching further into these errors and will definitely be modifying my website in the future for a more modern look to improve my CSS styling and arrangements.
